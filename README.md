# NLP-based Recommender System 

## Objectives:
The goal of this project is to build a recommender system using the NLP technique **Item2Vec** and hierarchical **Item2Vec**, and apply them across various use cases. The former is an item-based collaborative filtering technique and the latter is an hybrid approach which incorporates hierarchical content-based information.

## Dataset: 
RetailRocket Recommender System Dataset from Kaggle.
