    "*Recommender systems* suggest items to users based on their preferences, behavior, or similarities with others. They're widely used in platforms like Netflix, Amazon, Spotify, and YouTube. The primary goal is to predict a user’s preferences and recommend items they are likely to engage with such as movies, products, news articles, or even people. There are mainly two core types of recommender systems, **collaborative filtering** and **content-based filtering**. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Collaborative filtering** can be further divided into:\n",
    "* *User-based filtering*, which identifies users with similar preferences and recommends items those users have liked.\n",
    "* *Item-based filtering*, which finds items similar to those the user has previously liked and recommends them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarity between users or items is typically computed using distance or similarity measures such as *Euclidean distance, Pearson correlation*, or *cosine similarity*. It's important to note that in collaborative filtering, item similarity is not based on the inherent features of the items, but rather on user interaction patterns. Item-based collaborative filtering is particularly effective in systems where the number of users significantly exceeds the number of items. \n",
    "However, collaborative filtering has several limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data sparsity: User-item interaction matrices are often sparse, making it difficult to identify meaningful patterns.\n",
    "- Cold start: The system struggles to make recommendations for new users or new items due to a lack of interaction data.\n",
    "- Scalability: Performance can degrade as the number of users or items grows.\n",
    "- Popularity bias: Tends to over-recommend popular items, reducing personalization and diversity.\n",
    "- Lack of Interpretability: Recommendations are based on patterns in user behavior, not explicit item attributes.\n",
    "- Gray sheep problem: Users with unique or atypical preferences may receive poor recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Content-based filtering**, on the other hand, recommends items that are similar to those a user has liked in the past. These similarities are determined based on item attributes or features, such as categories, tags, genres, or other metadata. This approach can help address some of the limitations of collaborative filtering.\n",
    "\n",
    "- No Need for Other Users' Data: Recommendations are based solely on the user’s own preferences and item features.\n",
    "- Handles Cold Start (User Side): Can recommend items to new users after only a few interactions.\n",
    "- Interpretable Recommendations.\n",
    "- Less prone to recommending only popular items.\n",

This results in more effective recommendations through meaningful item embeddings.\n",

It effectively captures the orientation (rather than magnitude) of embedding vectors.

This makes it especially well-suited for tasks such as *ranking, retrieval, and recommendation*.\n",
